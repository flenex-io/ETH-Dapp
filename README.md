# ETH-DAPP

Welcome to ETH-DAPP, my first-ever decentralized application!

## Introduction
ETH-DAPP is a beginner-friendly project that showcases the basics of creating and interacting with a decentralized application on the Ethereum blockchain. While it currently has limited functionality, I'll be expanding its features in the future.

### Features
- **Send ETH**: The primary feature of ETH-DAPP is its ability to send 0.001 ETH to any Ethereum address. Although you can't customize the amount just yet, it serves as a stepping stone to understanding how transactions work on the blockchain.

## Getting Started
